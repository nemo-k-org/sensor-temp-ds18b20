# Nemo-K temperature sensor for DS18B20

## Overview

This is Nemo-K board for ESP-01 and well-known [DS18B20](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ds18b20.html) gauge.

Because of its measuring range (-55째C to +125째C, -67째F to +257째F) DS18B20 is ideal for all marine temperature
measurements e.g. salons, engine coolant, engine room. However, using this gauge for measuring except exhaust
pipe temperatures is out of its range.

The board is designed to be used with ESP-01 microcontroller running Nemo-K firmware.

The repository contains schematics and PCB in KiCad 8.0 format. The footprint properties contains LCSC part numbers
used by [JLCPBC.com](https://jlcpcb.com). If present, the `sensor-temp-ds18b20/production/` contains all necessary
files to order boards from JLCPCB. The production files can be easily re-created using
[KiCad Fabrication Toolkit](https://github.com/bennymeg/Fabrication-Toolkit).

## Changelog

* *v2* First working version. The labels "Sens Data" and "Sens 3.3V" of the temperature sensor screw terminal
  are the wrong way around. A reverse polarity protection diode should be added.
